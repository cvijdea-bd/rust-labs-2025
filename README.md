# Programming at the speed of Rust
We will write a parser for the Android Dalvik EXecutable (DEX) file format, and a simple decompiler for the dalvik bytecode contained within. While doing this we will gain an understanding of how code is executed on Android, while also learning how to write clean and efficient Rust code.
